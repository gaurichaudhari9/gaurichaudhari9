### Passion Project
I have been exposed to and grown around understanding the behavioral and psychological patterns of children on the Autism spectrum, especially partially/completely non-verbal children. Hence, I have been actively involved with Indian NGO's in building different types of communication models since 2017. My ultimate goal is to ultimately help parents communicate and understand their child on spectrum effectively.
